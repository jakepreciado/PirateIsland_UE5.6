# Overview

This is my first real game development project utilizing Unreal Engine 5. This is Pirate Island! Showcasing mechanics inspired from a traditional 3D platformer, a player can take control of Captain Barbarossa and walk, run and jump. The demo features a hand sculpted island, movable objects to kick around, a moving pirate ship and other animted NPC characters. 

The main purpose for this project to was to apply my learning of C++ in a previous module into learning Unreal Engines C++ scripting format. Game development is something I have always been intrigued by and this is just a step into the world of making my imagination come to life. 

# Development Environment

Unreal Engine 5.6
Visual Studio

Code for this project was written in C++.

Free assets used in this project (ie. Pirates and Environment props) were FREE to use and downloaded from [here](https://quaternius.com/packs/piratekit.html).

# Future Work

* I would like to create hit mechanics and utilize the pirate swords, create health/damage, etc.
* Be able to take control of the Pirate ship!
* Add NPC movements and enemy CPU behaviors to make the game more interactive.
